The auth_token config parameter is for use with Phantom instances. If both the token and username/password are given, the username and password will be used to authenticate to the Phantom instance.
<br><br>
Note that the IP (or name) being used must match the allowed IP in the remote Phantom instance's REST asset configuration.
<br><br>
In case the <b>phantom_server</b> configuration parameter is set to the current Phantom instance, i.e., the Phantom server through which the app is being used, then the <b>verify_certificate</b> should be set to False in the asset configuration.
<br><br>
For information on how to obtain an authorization token, see Provisioning an Authorization Token in the Phantom REST Overview documentation.
<br><br>
If the value provided in the <b>phantom_server</b> configuration parameter is 0.0.0.0 then the <b>test connectivity</b> passes successfully and the actions will run on the current phantom instance, i.e., the server through which the app is being used.
<br><br>
See <a href="https://my.phantom.us/kb/7/" target="_blank">KB article 7</a> and <a href="https://my.phantom.us/kb/16/" target="_blank">KB article 16</a> on how to create and verify a valid HTTPS certificate for your Phantom instance.

For security reasons, accessing 127.0.0.1 is not allowed.

<h2> Playbook Backward Compatibility </h2>
<ul>
  <li> The existing action parameters have been modified in the actions given below. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting the corresponding action blocks or by providing appropriate values to these action parameters to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Update List - The <b>row_values_as_list</b> parameter, has been changed from the comma-separated new values to a JSON formatted list of new values. This will allow the user to provide a value containing a comma(',') character. The example for the same has been updated in the example values.</li>
      <li> Add Artifacts - The <b>contains</b> parameter, can take a string(or a comma-separated list of string) or a JSON dictionary, with the keys matching the keys of the <b>cef_dictionary</b> and the values being lists of possible contains for the CEF field. In case, the <b>contains</b> parameter is a string(or a comma-separated list of string), the provided value will map to the <b>cef_name</b> parameter.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2> Known Issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li> The <b>find listitem</b> action is unable to fetch the list, where the <b>list name</b> contains a forward slash('/') character.</li>
  <li> The <b>add listitem</b> action is unable to update the list, where the <b>list name</b> contains a forward slash('/') character.</li>
  <li> The <b>find artifacts</b> action does not work as per the expectation, for the case where we have a backslash('\') character in the cef_value. This happens for both exact match and non-exact-match.</li>
  <li> The <b>find artifacts</b> action is unable to fetch the artifacts, where cef values contain Unicode character(s), on Phantom version 4.8.23319. The action works fine on Phantom version 4.5.15922.</li>
</ul>
